    <div class="project-description">
        <p>The project aims to represent the beauty and tenderness of the human body.Our bodies are getting older every day, they are constantly changing. We don't always notice these small changes straight away. The body renews itself, many cells are lost and replaced. Over time, our skin becomes thinner, drier and wrinkles form. </p>
        <p>The series shows a state of the body that will never be completely the same as in the pictures. As inhabitants of our body, we have become accustomed to its appearance. However, photography makes it possible to create images in which we - as viewers - are not sure which part of the body we are seeing or do not recognise the position of the body. </p>
        <p>The focus is also on a specific part of the body, which is emphasised from the body as a whole. The noise created by the black and white analogue technique gives the images a light, sensitive feel. This reminds us of how sensitive our bodies are, despite the fact that they can withstand so much, and the soft black and white contrasts reinforce the intimacy of the images. </p>
