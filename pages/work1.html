    <h2>Sound Campus design, 2023</h2>
        </div>
    <div class="project-description">
        <p>Since 2020, Sound Campus is a format hosted by the University of Arts Linz for students and performers to exchange and share with a wider audience. A series of performances, open sessions, radio broadcasts, workshops and itinerant installations ttok place around Hauptplatz 6 during the Ars Electronica Festival.</p>
        <p>For the visual language, a generative system was created with vvvv, which was used to create different images using the same graphics by changing the movement. This way the design had a uniform look with variation for every usage. It was used for moving and static images, in print and digital as well.</p>

    <h2>Digital usage</h2>

    <div class="project-description">
    <p>Instagram was the main tool for communication with the audience, so it was very important to create a straightforward feed, which would make it easy to find the relevant information. </p>
    <p>For the announcements, such as daily programmes and lists of the artists, I decided to create static images. The cathegories were indicated with a different usage of the four main color and with variations in typography.</p>

    <h2>Instagram</h2>
        </div>
    <div class="project-description">
    <p>An instagram post was created for every performing artist. The main idea was to find a way to show the artists and their works in one post. I decided to create a short video with audio to showcase the performances.
        Every video contained an image of the artist, an individual moving background and an audio snippet.</p>
