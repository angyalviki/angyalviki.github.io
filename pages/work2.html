        <p>Reconsolidated Memories is an interactive video installation, that was exhibited in 2023 at the Quantified Perspectives: Rethinking Data
            Narratives group exhibition in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg and it was part of the Resonating Selves-Interface Cultures student exhibition at Ars Electronica Festival 2023 in Linz.</p>

    <h2>Reconsolidation</h2>
        </div>
    <div class="project-description">
        <p> Recalling a memory from our past involves various
            areas of the brain, as memories are distributed
            throughout our neural networks. While retrieving a
            memory, it becomes susceptible to modification. Upon
            subsequent retrievals, we recall the altered version
            from the previous retrieval rather than the initial
            experience itself, which is known as reconsolidation. </p>

         <p>The installation uses pictures from the artistâ€™s personal
            archive from the age of 2,5 to illustrate how memories
            are processed and manipulated by the brain.</p>

    <div class="project-description">
        <p>The images are constantly distorted and morphed together.
            This emphasizes the idea that our memories are
            not static, but sensitive to change and constantly
            evolving. The longer the visitors watch, the more
            distorted the memories become, reflecting the phenomenon
            of reconsolidation.</p>
